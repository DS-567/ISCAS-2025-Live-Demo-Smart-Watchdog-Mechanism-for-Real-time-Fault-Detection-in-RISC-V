There were 8 stages to develop the smart watchdog, as shown below. **Include diagram**

**Stage 1 - Data Collection** : A custom hardware framework was developed to inject faults into RISC-V core and extract instruction data to text files, creating a library of instructions executed normally and with control flow errors occuring. (Hardware architecture will be discussed in a future publication).

**Stage 2 - Feature Extraction** : dfafagdg

**Stage 3 - Dataset Preprocessing** : dfafagdg

**Stage 4 - SNN Model Design** : dfafagdg

**Stage 5 - SNN Model Training** : dfafagdg

**Stage 6 - SNN Model Testing** : dfafagdg

**Stage 7 - Smart Watchdog Implementation** : dfafagdg

**Stage 8 - Smart Watchdog Validation** : dfafagdg
